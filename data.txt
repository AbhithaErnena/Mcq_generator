Photosynthesis, the plant’s magical cooking, unfolds in tiny kitchens called chloroplasts. These mini-factories, wrapped in a double layer, hold a green chef called chlorophyll. Inside, there are flat sacs called thylakoids, forming stacks named grana in a clear space called stroma.Chlorophyll, the chef’s assistant, loves catching red and blue light, giving plants their green color. This kitchen duo transforms air and water into yummy carbohydrates, and as a bonus, they serve up oxygen. It’s like a dance – sunlight, colors, and plant kitchens working together to make life’s essential recipe, the enchanting process of photosynthesis.
